# This is a meta repository for developers who want to work on writing/developing lessons.


## Overview

This repo contains scripts that download a set of the training repositories developed in the GitHub Organisation
Southampton-RSG-Training.

The initial shell script configure-remotes.sh clones and sorts each of the lesson,
workshop-test, and templates this takes some time and requires a significant amount of space ~7Gb.

The second script is used to create a live server in a Vagrant VM. This opens vm and runs jekyll serve to create a
server with live reload this means one can edit the documents live and see the updates in 'real time'. This requires
Vagrant and either Virtualbox or VMWare Fusion present on the host system, installation details are provided in
'VagrantBuild/README.md'.

Whilst care has been taken to create a set of tools that work on windows the experience is much better on MacOS and
Linux.

**If your device is using Apple Silicon or another ARM processor, you should checkout the `apple-m1` branch and use that
instead of `main`. This branch has been tweaked to use VMWare Fusion, because as of writing (1st March 2023) VirtualBox
does not support ARM processors and QEMU does not support the required networking features.**

### Before you start

You will require the following software.

- A terminal (bash)
- Vagrant (and virtualbox or VMWare Fusion)
- Rsync*
- FSwatch*
- Git
- An IDE (IntelliJ or VSCode recommended for templating workflow)

*With some differences between platforms

#### Windows

Windows causes a lot of headaches by not supporting many of the 'standard' unix tools.

If zstd is not in your GitBash path then it may need to be manually installed for the install_rsync_windows script
https://facebook.github.io/zstd/. Where this is the case the line 'zstd -d *.tar.zst' in install_rsync_windows will need
to be run manually.



Terminal: GitBash (https://gitforwindows.org)
Rsync: Requires a custom installation, see install_rsync_windows.sh
In a nutshell this downloads and extracts msys packages and dumps the executables into the git bash install.
FSwatch: Not supported as it requires GCC see install_fswatch_source.sh

#### MacOS
Git:
~~~
% xcode-select --install
~~~
FSwatch:
~~~
% brew install fswatch
~~~

#### Linux

FSWatch, please install with your preferred package manager.

## Running the Scripts

### Checkout this repo

To get started, configure git with SSH access, 'user.name', and 'user.email' on your local machine.

For configuring SSH access see these
[GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

Clone this repository:

~~~ bash
git clone git@github.com:Southampton-RSG-Training/TrainingProjects.git
~~~

### Download the other repos

Optional: Open configure-remotes.sh and remove lessons/templates that you will not want to work on, this helps save
space.

Run the shell script configure-remotes.sh. This clones (or pulls) listed training projects into a preconfigured folders
structure. It then adds the [remote template](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/lesson-template) which allows
for efficient updating of the build scripts and other boilerplate. In addition, it also downloads the Vagrant Build
directory that contains the tools to launch a local live update development server via a Vagrant vm.

_Note: This will take some time (~10 minutes) and take up several Gb of space_

~~~ bash
bash ./configure-remotes.sh
~~~

### Start a live server

We use Vagrant with the provider VirtualBox provisioned using Ansible. This automatically creates an inventory suitable
fo launching further jobs. However, deploying a lesson is a one liner

The following command will build the vagrant machine and run the jekyll server with auto-reload.

~~~bash
bash ./build-local.sh <local path to lesson> <optional name of provisioner>
~~~

e.g. to build the python lesson

~~~bash
bash ./build-local.sh Lessons/python-novice
~~~

_Please note the first time you run this script the vm is provisioned and this takes 10-20 minutes. Following builds are
much faster._


The script snapshots the VM, runs lesson server until receiving ctrl-c, and finally pops the snapshot to restore the VM
to a 'clean' ready state. so another lesson can be built.

Access the site in a browser using the following:
~~~
http://localhost/8124/
~~~

**Do not try to build multiple lessons simultaneously, I haven't tested it and bad things will happen. I _may_ look into
this in the future.**

**The optional argument for the provisioner is only required if you do not want to use the default choice. For
MacOS/ARM, VMWare Fusion will be used. All other platforms will use VirtualBox.**

# Common issues
### _contributions welcome via issues or PRs_

Problems:
If vagrant times out/hangs on ssh on an initial build
or,
If the virtual machine stops working
then,

~~~bash
cd VagrantBuild
vagrant destroy
vagrant up
~~~

If you want to poke at the VM:

~~~bash
cd VagrantBuild
vagrant ssh
~~~

## Platform specific notes,

#### Warning for WSL users: Currently shared folders are not supported in WSL. WSL is currently not supported see below.

On prompt allow access to public and private networks.

### MacOS

If you are using an Apple Silicon device, please checkout and use the `apple-m1` branch instead.

### Linux

### WSL

This is unsupported, PR welcome if fixes are available.

Install vagrant on WSL using apt/yum/snap/from-source
